# Analytics Vidhya Online Hackathon 
### Held on Aug 8,9

AnalyticsVidhya organized an online hackathon during the weekend Aug-8,9.

This is the question I tried to answer for this hackathon: How does some of the popular techniques predict on the dataset? I did no feature engineering. I took the data, and ran it on about a dozen models. I did no cross-validation and did no grid-search for hyper-parameters. 

Details of the hackathon can be found [here](http://discuss.analyticsvidhya.com/t/online-hackathon-3-0-find-the-next-brain-wong/2838)

Unsurprisingly, none of the models worked well on the leaderboard. But this can work as a quick-start benchmark code for such data.

The code, in notebook format, can be viewed [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rouseguy/Analytics-Vidhya-Hackathon-3/blob/master/Analytics_Vidhya_Hackathon3_Aug8-9.ipynb)
